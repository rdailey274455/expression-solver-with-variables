# expression-solver-with-variables

Type an ordinary infix expression with variables. Then, provide a map of variable values in order to calculate the expression's value. Sorry for my lack of comments. MathOctober.cpp is the "runner" file, RadExp.h declares the class and struct used to hold numbers and operators and stuff, RadExp.cpp is the implementation.
